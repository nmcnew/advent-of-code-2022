# Advent of Code 2022 

This is my attempt at doing the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).
Hopefully this doesn't end up being a complete shitshow.

## How to use

This is built on rust so you'll need to `rustup`: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

You can create your data files by doing (you'll need to paste the data file you get 
from AoC into each day):

```sh
cargo run -- -i
```

### Build
```sh
cargo build
```

### Run
```sh
cargo run -- [-e --each] [-d --day <DAY>] [-i --init]
```
